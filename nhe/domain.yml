  - text: "Have you ever wanted to be Rick for one day? In this game you will have the chance to and since you are an unapproachable nihilist, Morty’s aim is to determine you reveal your true personality, assuming you are willing to do so. He will make some statements and you have to answer whether you have done it or not. Watch out.. he had secretly found your “Inherent damage to Rick’s integrity” diary so he knows when you say the truth. If you’re being dishonest, Morty will notice and immediately lose hope about your attitude, so the game is over. Your aim should be answering all of the 15 statements in order to make Morty aware of your emotional and social development!"
