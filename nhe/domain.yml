  utter_greet:
  - text: "Have you ever wanted to be Rick for one day? In this game, you will embody his character and since you are an unapproachable nihilist, Morty’s aim is to determine you finally reveal your personality, assuming you are willing to do so. He will make some statements and you have to answer whether you have done it or not. Watch out.. he had secretly found your “Inherently damaging to Rick’s integrity” diary so he might know when you are being untruthful. If you’re being dishonest, Morty will notice and immediately give up on wanting to know you better, so the game is over. Your aim should be answering all of the 20 statements in order to make Morty proud of your emotional and social development!"
